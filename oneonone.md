## One-on-Ones (or) 1x1s (or) 1-1s 🤝
1-1s are the most crucial tool for a people leader. This meeting is one of the settings where coaching and feedback happen. 
I like to employ several kinds of 1-1s to build solid and lasting relationships and help grow my team members and myself.

## Coaching philosophy 🧐
My fundamental coaching philosophy is **Talk Less and Ask More Questions**.
I work hard not to be giving you advice and solutions all the time, but to make you think hard about the 
problems and support you in identifying and prioritizing solutions.

### Getting to know you 👋🏽
Whenever I take on a new team or hire a new employee, I use this unique 1-1 to set the tone for the relationship moving forward. 
I always come from a place of caring, so this is more about getting to know the person and what motivates them.

### Recurring 🔃
These are usually weekly, same time, same-day 30-minute meetings for direct reports. 
I encourage the individual to bring the agenda so they can cover topics relevant to them. 
However, I have a sample agenda that I use that typically helps guide the conversation and focus on essential things. 

#### Sample Agenda
1. **Check-in** ✅
- Did you do anything fun last week?
- What did you work on last week that made you happy?
- What drained your energy or annoyed you?

2. **Goals Update** 🎯
- How is work towards Sprint Goals coming along? Let's talk about people, project or patterns.
- Are there other things you think we should be working on as a team?

3. **Feedback** 🙌🏽
- What are things I am doing that are helping you do your job?
- What are things I am doing that are hindering you?

4. **Development Plan Progress** 🏅
We will usually dedicate one 1-1 every month to check progress and blockers with your development plan.
